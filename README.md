Hello, this repository exists to help anyone trying to explore reporting frequencies of the Merlin (Falco columbarius).

In order to initially run the R files, please download the free raw data for Merlin Occurrence from eBird, under its
'download eBird Data" web product.

You can contact Mandartijare25@gmail.com in case of any questions or missing, and I will be happy to help!
